## 📱 About KHIDMAT

**KHIDMAT** is an **Agentic AI Service Orchestrator** for Pakistan's informal economy, built for the **Google Antigravity Hackathon — Challenge 2**.

It automates the end-to-end lifecycle of a service request — from natural-language user intent to a confirmed booking with follow-up — connecting users with trusted local service providers (plumbers, electricians, AC technicians, tutors, beauticians and more) through a transparent multi-agent AI pipeline.

> **Not a listing app** — KHIDMAT demonstrates *agentic automation*: reasoning, decision-making, action simulation, and traceable workflow execution.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🤖 **6 AI Agents** working in a structured pipeline, end-to-end
- 💬 **Natural Language Chat** — Urdu, Roman Urdu, English & code-switched input
- 🔍 **Smart Provider Discovery** — filters by category, proximity & availability
- 🛡️ **Trust Scoring (BHAROSA)** — verified completion data, not just star ratings
- 💰 **Auto Negotiation (MOL-BHAAV)** — market-rate-aware price negotiation
- 📋 **Booking Simulation** — digital receipt with booking ID & price breakdown
- 🔔 **Follow-Up Automation** — reminders, status updates & rating prompts
- 🧾 **Agent Trace Logs** — full reasoning & decision trace for every request

## 🤖 The Agentic Pipeline

| Agent | Urdu Name | Role |
|-------|-----------|------|
| **FAHAM** | فہم | Intent parsing — language detection + service/location/time/urgency extraction |
| **DHOOND** | ڈھونڈ | Provider discovery — category & location matching |
| **BHAROSA** | بھروسا | Trust scoring — `completion×0.4 + speed×0.3 + vouches×0.2 + rating×0.1` |
| **MOL-BHAAV** | مول بھاؤ | Price negotiation — 2-round market-rate negotiation |
| **BOOK** | بُک | Booking confirmation & receipt generation |
| **YAAD-DAHANI** | یاد دہانی | Reminders & follow-up automation |

**Flow:** `Intent → Discovery → Trust → Negotiation → Booking → Follow-up`
